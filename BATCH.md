## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**

You can customize the shutdown schedule by editing these variables at the top of the batch file:

```batch
:: Configure times (24-hour format)
set "FIRST_DIALOG_HOUR=21"     :: First dialog at 9:30 PM
set "FIRST_DIALOG_MIN=30"
set "SECOND_DIALOG_HOUR=22"    :: Final dialog at 10:50 PM
set "SECOND_DIALOG_MIN=50"
set "SHUTDOWN_HOUR=23"         :: Shutdown at 11:00 PM
set "SHUTDOWN_MIN=00"

set "SECOND_DIALOG_MIN=50"
set "SHUTDOWN_HOUR=22"         :: 10:00 PM shutdown
set "SHUTDOWN_MIN=00"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Details**

### System Requirements

-   **Windows 7/8/10/11** (any version)
-   **Administrator privileges** recommended for reliable shutdown
-   **HTA support** (built into Windows)

### Files Created

-   `%TEMP%\shutdown_dialog.hta` - First dialog interface
-   `%TEMP%\shutdown_final_dialog.hta` - Final warning dialog
-   `%TEMP%\shutdown_*.tmp` - Temporary status files
-   `%USERPROFILE%\shutdown_scheduler.log` - Event log

### Background Operation

-   Script runs **hidden** in background after initial startup
-   **Minimal CPU usage** - only checks time every 30 seconds
-   **Automatic cleanup** of temporary files on exit

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### Script Doesn't Start

-   **Check file extension:** Must be `.bat` not `.txt`
-   **Run as Administrator:** Right-click ‚Üí "Run as administrator"
-   **Check startup folder:** Verify shortcut is in correct location

### Dialogs Don't Appear

-   **Check system time:** Ensure PC clock is accurate
-   **Review log file:** Look for error messages
-   **Test manually:** Run script directly to see immediate results

### Shutdown Doesn't Work

-   **Administrator privileges:** Script needs admin rights for shutdown
-   **Check Task Manager:** Look for mshta.exe processes (dialogs)
-   **Windows updates:** Restart may be required for some Windows updates

### Friday Issues

-   **Time zone:** Script uses local system time
-   **Regional settings:** Uses Windows date/time format
-   **Manual override:** Temporarily edit script to test on other days

## üéØ **Best Practices**

### For Optimal Performance

1. **Place script in permanent location** (not Desktop or Downloads)
2. **Run with administrator privileges** for reliable shutdown
3. **Monitor log file** occasionally to verify proper operation
4. **Test configuration changes** before relying on them

### For Security

1. **Keep script location secure** from unauthorized modification
2. **Regular log review** to detect any issues
3. **Backup your configuration** before making changes

## üìù **Advanced Customization**

### Modify Dialog Messages

Edit the HTA dialog creation sections to customize messages:

-   Look for lines containing `echo` and dialog text
-   Modify the text between quotes
-   Maintain the HTA syntax structure

### Change Visual Styling

Modify the CSS styles in the HTA sections:

-   Background colors, fonts, button styles
-   Dialog size and positioning
-   Color schemes and animations

### Add Email Notifications

Extend the script to send emails when shutdown occurs:

-   Use `blat` or similar command-line email tools
-   Add email sending logic before shutdown execution
-   Include log information in email body

## üí° **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the log file** for detailed error information
2. **Test with modified times** (2-3 minutes ahead) for immediate results
3. **Run manually** from command prompt to see any error messages
4. **Verify administrator privileges** by running as administrator

**Remember:** This script will shut down your PC automatically. Always save your work before the scheduled shutdown time!
